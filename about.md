<p align="justify">I'm a quantitative FX analyst at the Swiss National Bank and a lecturer 
	at the Faculty of Business and Economics of the University of Basel. 
	I obtained my PhD in Economics and Finance from the University of St. Gallen in 
2020. My research interests focus on applied financial econometrics and the use of new data 
sources to improve existing models. In my spare time, I like to
go climbing, hiking, and in the winter skiing. </p>
